# SpringBootActiveDirectory
A pretty minimal Spring Boot web app that demonstrates the following elements:
* Custom login form
* Public and protected resources
* Active Directory authentication
* Custom user details mapper to extract user's first and last name from Active Directory
* Thymeleaf extensions for Spring Security

Update the properties in application.properties to suit your environment.
